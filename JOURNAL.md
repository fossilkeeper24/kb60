## 11/2/2025 - Planned keyboard layout  

I made a plan for what I want the layout of my keyboard to look like:

It looks super close to the ANSI layout because it sort of is but it's still the slightest bit different.
For example, the (@) symbol and (") symbol are where they would be in ISO UK layout. 
And then instead of having the page up/down keys on the right side I have media control.
I just based it off of what I normally use the most.
I also would put volume knob in the corner but I wasn't sure exactly how to show that in keyboard-layout-editor.com so it's just shown as an average key.
